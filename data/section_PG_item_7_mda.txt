Financial Information about Segments
Information about our reportable segments can be found in the MD&A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Narrative Description of Business
Business Model
. Our business model is focused on delivering sustainable value creation by driving balanced top- and bottom-line growth. We create, manufacture, market and distribute a diversified portfolio of daily-use products to delight consumers with irresistible superiority across five key vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. We invest in research and development and consumer insights to invent new categories or products and innovate our existing products, ensuring they meet evolving consumer needs and preferences. We leverage marketing strategies including advertising, promotions and endorsements to drive brand awareness and loyalty among consumers. The Company utilizes various distribution channels, including retail stores, e-commerce platforms and direct-to-consumer platforms to deliver our products. Our business model relies on continued productivity improvements to fuel investments in research and development and marketing and deliver value creation. Our objective is to deliver sustainable and balanced top- and bottom-line growth while serving the needs of all stakeholders — consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners.
Key Product Categories
. Information on key product categories can be found in the MD&A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Key Customers
. Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. Sales to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 16% of our total sales in 2025 and 2024 and 15% in 2023. No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 43% of our total net sales in 2025, 42% in 2024 and 40% in 2023.
Sources and Availability of Materials
. Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source suppliers. We produce certain raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing processes and in the transportation of input materials and finished products. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation including new or increased tariffs. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which are material to our business taken as a whole.
Trademarks and Patents
. We own or have rights to patents and trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Our patents cover a range of product features, including significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks and patents.
Competitive Condition
. The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products from a broad range of companies, both large and small, both established and new, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. In this highly competitive setting, we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. Our integrated strategy and our focus on driving superiority across product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value are key differentiators in the marketplace.
2        The Procter & Gamble Company
Government Regulation
. Our Company is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business. In the United States, many of our products and manufacturing operations are subject to one or more federal or state regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and antitrust and competition laws and regulations that govern our dealings with suppliers, customers, competitors and government officials.
In addition, many foreign jurisdictions in which we do business have regulations and regulatory bodies that govern similar aspects of our operations and products, in some cases to an even more significant degree. We are also subject to expanding laws and regulations related to environmental protection and other sustainability-related matters, non-financial reporting and diligence, labor and employment, trade, taxation and privacy and data protection, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and similar regulations in states within the United States and in countries around the world.
The Company has in place compliance programs and internal and external experts to help guide our business in complying with these and other existing laws and regulations that apply to us around the globe; and we have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with these laws and regulations. We also expect that our many suppliers, consultants and other third parties working on our behalf share our commitment to compliance, and we have policies and procedures in place to manage these relationships, though they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over operations and governance. We do not expect that the Company’s expenditures for compliance with current government regulations, including current environmental regulations, will have a material effect on our total capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in fiscal year 2026 as compared to prior periods.
Human Capital
. Our employees are a key source of competitive advantage. Their actions, guided by our Purpose, Values and Principles (PVPs), are critical to the long-term success of our business. We aim to retain our talented employees by offering competitive compensation and benefits, strong career development and a respectful and inclusive culture that provides equal opportunity for all.
Our Board of Directors, through the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (C&LD Committee), provides oversight of the Company’s policies and strategy relating to talent, including equality and inclusion, as well as the Company’s compensation principles and practices. The C&LD Committee also evaluates and approves the Company’s compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior executives.
Employees
As of June 30, 2025, the Company had approximately 109,000 employees, an increase of 2% versus the prior year due to business growth. The total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding interns, co-ops, contractors and employees of joint ventures. 49% of our employees are in manufacturing roles and 28% of our employees are located in the United States. 42% of our global employees are women and 32% of our U.S. employees identify as multicultural.
Training and Development
We focus on attracting, developing and retaining the broadest pool of talent available, both from universities and the broader market. We recruit from universities across markets in which we compete and are generally able to select from the top talent. We focus on developing our employees by providing a variety of job experiences, training programs and skill development opportunities. Given our develop-from-within model for staffing most of our senior leadership positions, it is particularly important for us to ensure holistic growth and full engagement of our employees.
Equality and Inclusion
As a global consumer products company, P&G serves consumers around the world with operations in approximately 70 countries. We believe that it is good for business that our workforce is drawn from the best available talent from communities worldwide, with insights about, connectivity to and understanding of all our consumers. Further, a foundational component of P&G's strategy and success has been to foster an inclusive work environment, in which we develop and advance the very best capabilities that all our people have to offer. Globally, we aspire to reflect the diversity of the consumers we serve in the communities where we operate and are committed to creating a superior employee experience for all. Our aspiration is founded on our longstanding values and principles for equal opportunity and compliance with the law.
Compensation and Benefits
Market-competitive compensation and reward programs are critical elements of our employee value equation to attract and retain the best talent. Our total rewards programs are based on the principles of paying for performance, paying competitively versus peer companies that we compete with for talent in the marketplace and focusing on long-term success through a combination of short-term and long-term incentive programs. We also offer competitive benefit programs, including retirement plans and health insurance, in line with local country practices, with flexibility to accommodate the needs of a diverse workforce.
Sustainability
. Environmental sustainability is integrated into our business strategy. We are focused on designing and manufacturing irresistibly superior products that are more sustainable. We aim to reduce our own environmental footprint and
The Procter & Gamble Company        3
enable our consumers to reduce their footprint without compromising on the performance of the products they use. We develop and license technologies that can be used across industries to improve environmental sustainability at a broader scale.
Combined, this approach intends to positively impact the total environmental impact of the Company while driving market growth and value creation.
In 2021, the Company announced a 2040 net zero ambition. Our Climate Transition Action Plan outlines the Company’s ongoing efforts toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions across scopes 1 and 2 and elements of scope 3. The Company has also declared ambitions towards purchasing renewable electricity for our operations, reducing intensity of virgin petroleum-based plastic in packaging, designing more consumer packaging to be recyclable or reusable, responsible sourcing of key forest-based commodities, improving efficiency of water usage in our operations and driving a global portfolio of water restoration projects in key water basins. While we have met or exceeded some of the goals and are making significant progress against others, scalable infrastructure and cost-effective solutions are not yet available to us to fully deliver against some of our stated ambitions.
Sustainability related disclosures included in this Annual Report, our Proxy Statement and our sustainability reports are informed by standards and guidelines such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The “materiality” thresholds in those standards and guidelines may differ from the concept of “materiality” for purposes of the federal securities laws and disclosures required by the Commission’s rules in this Annual Report. References to our sustainability reports and website are for informational purposes only and neither the sustainability reports nor the other information on our website is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional detailed information on our sustainability efforts can be found on our website at https://pginvestor.com/esg.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors.
We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, as well as in our quarterly and annual reports, current reports on Form 8-K, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except to the extent required by law. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations.
The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends, perhaps materially.
MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND RELATED FINANCIAL RISKS
Our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls.
We are a global company, with operations in about 70 countries and products sold in about 180 countries and territories around the world. We hold assets, incur liabilities, generate sales and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our operations outside the U.S. generate more than 50% of our annual net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have and could continue to reduce the U.S. dollar value of sales, earnings and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition.
Further, we have a significant amount of debt including floating rate and foreign currency debt and derivatives as part of our capital markets activities. As we refinance debt or renew derivatives, we are exposed to movement in global interest rates and rate differentials. Further, the maturity cash outflows of foreign currency debt and derivative instruments could be adversely impacted by significant appreciation of foreign currency exchange rates (particularly the Euro), which could adversely impact our overall cash flows and interest expense. Moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could adversely affect our results. See also the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MD&A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.
We also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business.
4        The Procter & Gamble Company
Uncertain economic or social conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business.
Our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic or social disruptions. These disruptions have included and may in the future include: a slow-down, recession or inflationary pressures in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; a significant shift in government policies; significant social unrest; the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions; potential negative consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. Additionally, these and other economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient sales, income and cash flow, it could affect the Company’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments.
Changing political and geopolitical conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results.
Changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, as well as changing geopolitical conditions, may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. Results of elections, referendums, sanctions or other political processes and pressures in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed have created and could continue to create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, tariffs, import and export controls and the general movement of goods, materials, services, capital, data and people between countries. The potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, variability and unpredictability in trade relations such as U.S. trade relations, new or increased tariffs, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and cash flows.
The Company operates a global business with sales, manufacturing, distribution and research and development organizations globally that contribute to our overall growth. If geopolitical tensions and trade controls continue to increase or disrupt our business in markets where we have significant sales or operations, including disruptions due to governmental responses to such conflicts (such as the imposition of sanctions, export controls, retaliatory tariffs, restrictions on cross-border data transfers, increased business licensing requirements or limitations on profits), such disruptions could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our business, operations or employees have been and could continue to be adversely affected (including by the need to de-consolidate or even exit certain businesses in particular countries) by geopolitical conflicts, political volatility, trade controls, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions. This could include political instability, upheaval or acts of war and the related responses of governments or other entities (including, but not limited to, boycotts in certain regions), broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets.
For example, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted, and the situation it generates may continue to negatively impact, our operations. Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty as to how the overall situation will continue to evolve. We may reduce further or discontinue our operations in Russia due to sanctions and export controls and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, restrictions on data transfers or access to financial institutions and services, supply and transportation challenges or other circumstances and considerations. Ultimately, these could result in operational disruptions, loss of assets or impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital.
More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation worsen, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures, energy and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe.
Changes in geopolitical conditions could also amplify or affect the other risk factors set forth in this Part I, Item 1A, including, but not limited to, foreign exchange volatility, disruptions to the financial and credit markets, energy supply and supply chain disruptions, increased risks of an information security or operational technology incident, cost fluctuations and commodity cost increases and increased costs to ensure compliance with global and local laws and regulations.
Disruptions in credit markets or to our banking partners or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit or overall liquidity.
A disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. In addition, we rely on top-tier banking partners in key markets around the world, who themselves face economic, societal, political and other risks, for access to credit and to
The Procter & Gamble Company        5
facilitate collection, payment and supply chain finance programs. A disruption to one or more of these top-tier partners could impact our ability to draw on existing credit facilities or otherwise adversely affect our cash flows or the cash flows of our customers and vendors.
BUSINESS OPERATIONS RISKS
Our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain.
Our ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes or controversies, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity or disruptions in our internal information and data systems or those of our suppliers, cybersecurity incidents including but not limited to ransomware attacks, misuse of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials (including water, recycled materials and materials that meet our labor standards), significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism, disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control, have at times interrupted and could, in the future, interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our results.
Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities (including certain petroleum-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp), raw and packaging materials and the costs of labor, tariffs, transportation (including trucks and containers), energy, pensions and healthcare. Inflation pressures sometimes result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations and to anticipate consumer reaction to our management of these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.
The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.
The consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.
A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.
We sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. Our success depends on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or, for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.
If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.
The Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the Company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related
6        The Procter & Gamble Company
litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, negative perceptions of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleum-based materials), lack of recyclability or other environmental attributes, concerns about actual or alleged labor, equality and inclusion or social practices, privacy failures or data breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability. While the Company has many programs and initiatives to further these citizenship efforts, we are impacted in part by the actions and efforts of third parties including local and other governmental authorities, suppliers, vendors and customers. Consumer or broader stakeholder perceptions of these programs and initiatives widely vary and could adversely affect our business. If these programs are changed or suffer negative publicity, the Company's reputation and results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.
We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.
Due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, for certain functions. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Further, failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to the Company, including the transparency and accuracy of the disclosures of ingredients in materials or processes, and the proper security of Company data and personal data, or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the Company and these third parties could adversely impact our operations and financial results. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk.
A significant information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity incident, or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes and/or associated sites involving the Company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation.
We rely extensively on information and operational technology (IT/OT) systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms. Many of these are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors. The various uses of these IT/OT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; shipping, marketing and selling products; collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data; summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms; hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications; complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business.
Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. In addition, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber-attacks frequently change, continue to advance in sophistication and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we and our third-party providers may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack, including acquired and divested businesses.
Our IT/OT databases and systems and our third-party providers’ databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber-attacks. Such attacks may originate from outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors, including nation states. In addition, operational errors and insider actors - malicious or otherwise - could cause technical disruptions and/or data incidents. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches, operational outages or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers’ IT/OT databases or systems.
A breach of our data security systems or failure of our IT/OT databases and systems and those of our third-parties may have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results. If the IT/OT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive
The Procter & Gamble Company        7
business or stakeholder information, including personal information, due to any number of causes, including catastrophic events, natural disasters, power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, improper data handling, viruses, phishing attempts, cyber-attacks, malware and ransomware attacks, security incidents, misuse or malicious use of artificial intelligence or employee error or malfeasance, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. If our critical IT systems or back-up systems or those of our third-party vendors are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them.
In addition, if a ransomware attack, other cybersecurity incident or operational disruption occurs, either internally or at our third-party providers, we could be prevented from accessing our data or systems, which may cause interruptions or delays in our business operations, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to demands to pay a ransom or damage our reputation. In addition, such events could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of confidential information or stakeholder information, including personal data from customers, consumers, employees, vendors, investors and other stakeholders, and we may suffer financial and reputational damage as a result. Additionally, we could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, governmental inquiries, reporting requirements, investigations or regulatory enforcement actions; and we could be subject to payment of fines or other penalties, legal claims by our suppliers, customers or employees and significant remediation costs.
Periodically, we and/or our suppliers also upgrade IT/OT systems or adopt new technologies, including those enabled by machine learning or artificial intelligence. If such a new system or technology does not function properly, provides flawed or inaccurate outputs or exposes us to increased cybersecurity incidents and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. The costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows and generate negative publicity affecting Company reputation and relationships among consumers, customers and other business partners.
We must successfully manage the demand, supply and operational challenges associated with the effects of any future disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns.
Our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public health concern. These impacts may include, but are not limited to:
•
Significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products or stockpiling or similar pantry-loading activity. If prolonged, such impacts can further increase the difficulty of business or operations planning and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows; or
•
Significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, import/export restrictions, tariffs, price controls, or governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations.
Despite efforts to manage and remedy these impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects.
BUSINESS STRATEGY & ORGANIZATIONAL RISKS
Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation, evolving digital marketing and selling platforms and changing consumer habits.
We are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. The success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others and to continue to deliver efficient and effective marketing across evolving media and mobile platforms with dynamic and increasingly more restrictive privacy requirements. We must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors, customers and vendors. Failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves, changing consumer habits and platform evolution, including the timely, responsible and effective adoption of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
8        The Procter & Gamble Company
We must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities.
As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results have been, and in the future could be, adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures. Our results of operations and cash flows have been, and in the future could also be, impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities, if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges, which could also result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change, including attracting and retaining key talent as part of our overall succession planning.
Our financial projections assume certain new and ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments and employee departures. Failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, successfully executing organizational change, management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and motivation and retention of key employees is critical to our business success. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include: employee morale; our reputation; the impacts of political, social and geopolitical polarization; competition from other employers and availability of qualified individuals. Our success depends on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans.
LEGAL & REGULATORY RISKS
We must successfully manage compliance with current and expanding laws and regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the U.S. and abroad.
Our business is subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations across the countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, product composition or formulation, manufacturing processes, packaging content or corporate responsibility for packaging and product disposal, marketing, antitrust and competition, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection and data transfers, artificial intelligence, environmental (including increasing focus on the climate, nature, water and waste impacts of consumer packaged goods companies' operations and products), employment, healthcare, anti-bribery and anti-corruption (including interactions with health care professionals and government officials as well as corresponding internal controls and record-keeping requirements), trade (including tariffs, sanctions and export controls), tax, accounting and financial reporting or other matters. In addition, governmental and societal attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, including changing and differing mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change, waste production, water usage, nature impacts, human capital, respect for human rights, labor and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. These and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies, create challenges for the Company, may alter the environment in which we do business, may increase the ongoing costs and complexities of compliance including by requiring investments in technology or other compliance systems and may ultimately result in the need to cease manufacturing, sales or other business activities in certain jurisdictions, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. Additionally, we are currently, and in the future may be, subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, claims, proceedings and requests for information from governmental agencies or private parties, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business. Failure to successfully manage these new or pending regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, if new or pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position.
Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results.
The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the various tax laws can and do occur. For example, in July 2025, the U.S. government enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the 2025 U.S. Tax Act). The 2025 U.S. Tax Act extended or made permanent many of the corporate tax changes arising under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in 2017 (the 2017 U.S. Tax Act). We do not anticipate the 2025 U.S. Tax Act to have a material impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or effective tax rate.
The Procter & Gamble Company        9
In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued “Pillar Two” model rules which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for large multinational corporations. Many countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing Pillar Two legislation into their respective domestic laws. Based on current legislation, available guidance and the June 28, 2025 G7 Pillar Two Statement committing to a side-by-side solution for U.S. parented groups, we do not anticipate the Pillar Two global minimum tax to have a material impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or effective tax rate. The Company continues to assess the overall impact of potential changes as developments occur, consistent with our practice to monitor all changes in tax laws. As the Pillar Two global minimum tax and other tax laws and related regulations are revised, enacted and implemented, a material impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or effective tax rate may occur.
Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities. While we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 Beauty Brands transaction with Coty, may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.

Item 1C.
Cybersecurity.
Risk Management and Strategy
The Company employs multiple tools and processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. A multi-functional enterprise security team reviews and assesses top cybersecurity risks. This assessment is shared with members of senior management, including the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and helps guide the Company's cybersecurity operational priorities and strategy.
In addition, cybersecurity risks are integrated into the Company’s broader Enterprise Risk Management program.
 When cybersecurity risks are identified through the Enterprise Risk Management program or otherwise, they are reported to relevant business and governance leaders within the Company for appropriate action.
To support the ongoing identification and management of cybersecurity issues, the Company provides information security employee training, conducts global and targeted phishing simulation campaigns and conducts tabletop exercises. The Company also deploys a large library of security tools and experts to help prevent, detect, contain, eradicate and recover from potential cybersecurity issues and cyber-attacks.
Further, the Company engages third-party consultants and services for cyber intelligence, insights and assessments of its cybersecurity risk posture and governance.

Cybersecurity reviews are embedded into the Company’s Third-Party Risk Management program. Generally under this program, third parties that process personal data or high-risk business data on behalf of the Company complete privacy and cybersecurity assessments on a risk basis, which may require such third parties to sign data processing agreements, comply with particular security controls or complete an additional security and privacy assessment.
As a global company, we manage a variety of cybersecurity threats and cannot wholly eliminate the risk of adverse impacts from such incidents.
However, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we have not identified any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of our operations or financial condition.
 For additional information on the risks from cybersecurity threats that we have faced in the past and expect to continue to face in the future, please refer to the “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Governance
The Company’s Board of Directors oversees cybersecurity risks consistent with its general risk oversight responsibility.
The Audit Committee of the Board has specific responsibility for reviewing the status of the security of the Company’s electronic data processing information systems and the general security, including cybersecurity, of the Company’s people, assets and information systems.

In support of this general oversight, the full Board reviews, at least annually, the most significant enterprise risks facing the Company, including cybersecurity risks, as identified in the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management program. This review, which includes key members of senior management, covers key risks from information security that have been identified and corresponding action plans.
 The Audit Committee also receives regular updates from the Company’s CIO and CISO about the Company’s information security and systems security programs and plans, including emerging trends and progress on overall enterprise cybersecurity programs and priorities. These updates occur at least three times a year, with interim updates as needed.

The Company’s management is responsible for implementing its strategic plans, including identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating the risks inherent in them, such as cybersecurity risks. Within management, the Company’s
CISO
 has specific responsibility for cybersecurity risk management, reporting to the CIO.
The Company’s CISO has over 15 years of experience in cybersecurity, information security and information risk management, including several years each in security engineering and in operations, as well as running incident response organizations. The CISO's organization includes a dedicated team of centralized information security experts and a network of security professionals embedded in each business unit and function.

10        The Procter & Gamble Company
The CISO also leads the design and development of the Company’s cybersecurity program, relying on functional experts within the central Information Security organization as well as on information security experts within each of the Company’s Organizational Units. These embedded experts are responsible for the execution of the Company’s overall information security strategy and report security risks in their area of responsibility to their Organization Unit leader and to the CISO. Experts within the Company’s central Information Security organization help develop the Company’s cybersecurity strategies, policies and standards and similarly report security risks within the central enterprise to the CISO.
A central team within the Company leads enterprise-wide incident investigations and response, assisting and consulting on cyber security incidents impacting individual Organizational Units. Alerts of potential incidents can arise from security tool alerts, employee reports, threat intelligence sources, threat hunting activities or external entities, among other sources. The Company's Security Operations Center initially responds to incident alerts and notifies central experts to any potentially significant cybersecurity incidents. Members of the Security Operations Center and relevant response teams work to contain and eradicate potential and identified threats and support the system’s recovery efforts, advised as needed by the Legal department and other Company experts. Incidents are communicated to the CISO and other members of management, including the Company’s Ethics & Compliance Committee, as well as the Audit Committee of the Board, based on documented escalation criteria. The central enterprise team also regularly reviews incident reports to update the CISO.
As described above, both the CIO and CISO report information about the Company’s identification and management of cybersecurity risks to the Audit Committee.

Properties.
In the U.S., we own and operate 24 manufacturing sites located in 18 different states. In addition, we own and operate 75 manufacturing sites in 32 other countries. Many of the domestic and international sites manufacture products for multiple businesses. Beauty products are manufactured at 21 of these locations; Grooming products at 17; Health Care products at 20; Fabric & Home Care products at 34; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care products at 36. We own our Corporate headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. We own or lease our principal regional general offices in Switzerland, Panama, Singapore, China and the United Arab Emirates. We own or lease our principal regional shared service centers in Costa Rica, the United Kingdom and the Philippines. Management believes that the Company's sites are adequate to support the business and that the properties and equipment have been well maintained.
Item 3.
Legal Proceedings.
The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. In addition, SEC regulations require that we disclose certain environmental proceedings arising under Federal, State or local law when a governmental authority is a party and such proceeding involves potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed a certain threshold ($1 million or more).
On November 22, 2023, Procter & Gamble UK (“P&G UK”), a United Kingdom based wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, received notification from the U.K. Environment Agency of its intent to assess an unspecified civil penalty for P&G UK’s prior inadvertent failure to secure a required permit for its London-based manufacturing site under the European Union’s and United Kingdom’s Emission Trading Systems. Among other requirements, these Emissions Trading Systems require registration of the site and accounting of and payment for certain past greenhouse gas emissions. The site has been properly registered since March 2021, and P&G UK proactively notified the U.K. Environment Agency after learning of the prior issue. In July 2025, the U.K. Environmental Agency notified P&G UK of its intent to impose a civil penalty of less than $2 million. The matter is not yet resolved.
There are no other relevant matters to disclose under this Item for this period. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on certain legal proceedings for which there are contingencies.
This item should be read in conjunction with the Company's Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A for additional information.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein is included in the section titled "Economic Conditions and Uncertainties" and the section titled "Risk Factors" (Part I, Item 1A) of this Form 10-K.
Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures
The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:
•
Overview
•
Summary of 2025 Results
•
Economic Conditions and Uncertainties
•
Results of Operations
•
Segment Results
•
Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity
•
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
•
Other Information
Throughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP, including organic sales growth, Core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.
The Procter & Gamble Company        15
Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. In our presentation of data in tables or other charts, certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.
OVERVIEW
P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries.
Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.
Organizational Structure
Our organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).
Sector Business Units
The Company's product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets (referred to as Focus Markets) representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).

Enterprise Markets
Enterprise Markets are responsible for sales and profit delivery in specific countries, supported by SBU-agreed innovation and supply chain plans, along with scaled services like planning, distribution and customer management.
Corporate Functions
Corporate Functions provides company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources, information technology and legal services.
Global Business Services
Global Business Services provides scaled services in technology, process and data tools to enable the SBUs, the EMs and CF to better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class services and solutions that drive value for P&G.
Strategic Focus
Procter & Gamble aspires to serve the world’s consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.
Our strategy is to deliver and sustain value creation through five integrated choices: a portfolio of daily-use products where performance drives brand choice; superiority across product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value; productivity; constructive disruption of the entire value chain; and a highly efficient and effective organization structure.
The Company competes in daily-use product categories where performance plays a significant role in the consumer's choice of brands, and therefore, plays to P&G's strengths. Our focused portfolio of businesses consists of product categories where P&G has strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies with typically leadership market positions.
Within these categories, our strategic choices are focused on delighting and winning with consumers. Our consumers are at the center of everything we do. We win with consumers by delivering irresistible superiority across five key vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires superior innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G’s lifeblood. Superior products delivered with superior execution drive market growth, value creation for retailers and build share growth for P&G.
Ongoing productivity improvement is strategic and crucial to delivering our balanced top- and bottom-line growth, cash generation and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement enables investments to strengthen the superiority of our brands via product and packaging innovation, more efficient and effective supply chains, equity and awareness-building brand advertising and other programs and expansion of sales coverage and research and development programs. Productivity improvements also enable us to mitigate and manage through periods of challenging cost environments (including periods of increasing commodity, inflation and negative foreign exchange impacts). Our objective is to drive productivity improvements across all elements of the statement of earnings and balance sheet, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional spending, overhead costs and capital spending.
We act with agility and are constructively disrupting our highly competitive industry and the way we do business, including how we innovate, communicate and leverage new technologies, to create more value.
We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.
Additionally, to further strengthen our integrated strategy, we have declared four focus areas. These are 1) leveraging environmental sustainability as an additional driver of superior performing products and packaging innovations, 2) increasing digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce cost and enable rapid and efficient decision making, 3) developing next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity and 4) delivering a superior employee value equation for all employees inclusive of all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent to better serve our increasingly diverse consumer base.
We believe this strategy is right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.
The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term growth algorithm will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive, fast-moving consumer goods peer group:
•
Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;
18        The Procter & Gamble Company
•
Core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits; and
•
Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.
While periods of significant macroeconomic pressures may cause short-term results to deviate from the long-term growth algorithm, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing in our business.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Limited Market Portfolio Restructuring
In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company started a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed this limited market portfolio restructuring with the substantial liquidation of its operations in Argentina and recorded incremental restructuring charges of $801 million after tax, comprised primarily of non-cash charges for accumulated foreign currency translation losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). The total incremental restructuring charges incurred under the program beginning in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, through the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, were $1.2 billion after tax. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, resulting charges were funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Restructuring charges above the normal ongoing level of restructuring costs were reported as non-core charges. For more details on the restructuring program, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Intangible Asset Impairment
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge on an indefinite-lived intangible asset acquired as part of the Company’s 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value. For a more detailed discussion of the Gillette impairment, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Focused Portfolio, Supply Chain and Productivity Plan
In June 2025, the Company announced a portfolio and productivity plan to streamline its portfolio and organization to improve its cost structure and competitiveness. The Company expects to incur approximately $1.5 to $2.0 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a two-year period, including costs incurred as part of this plan and the ongoing plan. The Company expects to incur half of the costs under this plan by the end of fiscal 2026, with the remainder incurred in fiscal 2027.
The restructuring activities will be executed across the Sector Business Units as well as the Enterprise Markets, Corporate Functions and Global Business Services. These restructuring activities include a plan for a reduction of up to 7,000 non-manufacturing overhead personnel by the end of fiscal 2027.
Glad Joint Venture Agreement
The Company and The Clorox Company (Clorox) have jointly decided not to renew the Glad joint venture agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Clorox will purchase the Company’s minority interest in the venture at fair market value as of the agreement termination in January 2026. Subject to market conditions and the parties' negotiations with respect to fair market value, the Company expects to receive cash proceeds of approximately $500 million and record an after-tax gain in the range of $250 to $300 million in the third quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2026.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Global Economic Conditions.
 Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprised approximately 21% of our net sales in fiscal 2025. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to various risks due to economic, political and social instabilities, market volatility, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, new or increased tariffs, foreign exchange and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for 1% of consolidated net sales, net earnings and net assets as of June 30, 2025.
Foreign Exchange.
 We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, which have negatively impacted net sales, net earnings and cash flows. In response to the devaluation of foreign currencies (including those deemed highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.
Commodities and Supply Chain.
Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution operations can lead to increased costs. Legal or regulatory requirements and sustainability initiatives may result in increased costs. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may negatively impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.
Government Policies.
 We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on "Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy”. Government controls such as currency exchanges, pricing and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements can also impact our financial performance.
For additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, SG&A, operating margin, other non-operating items, income taxes and net earnings. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-
20        The Procter & Gamble Company
store and online) and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.
Our cost of products sold and SG&A are variable in nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in SG&A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased advertising), inflation, foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.

Net Sales
Net sales increased $245 million to $84.3 billion in fiscal 2025 as an increase in net sales driven by pricing of 1% was mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 1%. Volume and mix were unchanged versus the prior year.
Net sales increased low single digits in Health Care and was unchanged in Grooming, Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Net sales decreased low single digits in Beauty. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 2%. Organic sales increased low single digits in all Sector Business Units.

Gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 51.2% of net sales. The decrease in gross margin was due to:
•
110 basis points of decline from unfavorable product mix,
•
50 basis points of product and packaging investments,
•
30 basis points of higher commodity costs,
•
20 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts,
•
10 basis points of higher transportation costs and other costs and
•
10 basis points of higher costs from tariffs.
These decreases were partially offset by:
•
180 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings and
•
30 basis points of increase due to higher pricing.
Total SG&A decreased 3% to $22.7 billion and SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points to 26.9% due to decreased marketing spending and higher foreign exchange transactional charges in the prior year period.
•
Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points due to a decrease in marketing spending and productivity savings.
•
Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points as wage inflation headwinds were more than offset by productivity savings, which includes adjustments to variable compensation payouts.
•
Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points driven by favorable foreign exchange impacts.
Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 140 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.
The Procter & Gamble Company        21
Operating income increased $1.9 billion, or 10%, to $20.5 billion and operating margin increased 220 basis points to 24.3% due primarily to the decrease in SG&A and the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset in the prior year. For further discussion of the Gillette impairment charge, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Non-Operating Items
•
Interest expense was $907 million, a decrease of $18 million versus the prior year.
•
Interest income was $469 million, a decrease of $4 million versus the prior year.
•
Other non-operating income, net decreased $514 million to $154 million primarily driven by the higher non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina in the current year compared to the same charge due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Nigeria in the prior year.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate for fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, was 20.3%, compared to 20.2% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina, partially offset by favorable geographic mix impacts.
Net Earnings
Earnings before income taxes increased $1.4 billion, or 7%, to $20.2 billion as the increase in operating income, the components of which are discussed above, were partially offset by the non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina. Net earnings increased $1.1 billion, or 7%, to $16.1 billion due to the increase in earnings before income taxes, partially offset by the effective income tax rate increase discussed above.
Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $45 million due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.
Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1.1 billion, or 7%, to $16.0 billion.
Diluted EPS increased $0.49, or 8%, to $6.51 due primarily to the increase in net earnings.
SEGMENT RESULTS
Segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs which are reported in Corporate and are included as part of the Corporate discussion. Additionally, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our consolidated effective tax rate are included in Corporate. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on items included in Corporate.

22        The Procter & Gamble Company
Beauty net sales decreased 2% to $15.0 billion as the negative impact of unfavorable mix of 2% (due primarily to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, which has higher than segment-average selling prices), unfavorable foreign exchange of 1% and a unit volume decrease of 1% was partially offset by the positive impact of higher pricing of 2%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 1%. Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.3 points.
•
Hair Care net sales decreased low single digits. Positive impacts of favorable product mix and higher pricing (driven by Latin America, Europe and North America) were partially offset by negative impacts of divestitures, unfavorable foreign exchange and a unit volume decline. The unit volume decline was driven by a decline in Greater China (due to market contraction and the impact of divestitures), partially offset by increases in Latin America and Europe (both due to market growth). Organic sales increased low single digits due to double-digit growth in Latin America, mid-single-digit growth in Europe and low single-digit growth in North America, partially offset by a high single-digit decline in Greater China. Global market share of the hair care category decreased 0.9 points.
•
Personal Care net sales increased high single digits due to a unit volume increase and the positive impacts of higher pricing (driven by North America), partially offset by negative impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange. The unit volume increase was driven by growth in North America (due to innovation), Europe (due to distribution expansion and innovation) and Latin America (due to market growth), partially offset by a decline in Greater China (due to market contraction). Organic sales increased high single digits due to a more than 20% increase in Europe, a high-teens increase in Latin America and a high single-digit increase in North America, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decrease in Greater China. Global market share of the personal care category increased 0.5 points.
•
Skin Care net sales decreased high single digits. A unit volume decrease and negative impacts of unfavorable product mix were partially offset by the positive impacts of higher pricing (driven by Greater China and Asia Pacific). The unit volume decrease was driven by a decline in North America (due to distribution losses). Organic sales also decreased high single digits due to mid-teens declines in North America and Asia Pacific and a low single-digit decline in Greater China. Global market share of the skin care category decreased 0.7 points.
Net earnings decreased 8% to $2.7 billion due to the decrease in net sales and a 140 basis-point decline in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to a decrease in gross margin and an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. The gross margin decline of 130 basis points was driven by unfavorable product mix (due to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand) and higher commodities, partially offset by increased productivity savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to an increase in overhead spending and a reduction in net sales. The lower effective tax rate was driven by favorable geographic mix.

Grooming net sales were unchanged at $6.7 billion driven by a 2% increase in unit volume and higher pricing of 2% across all regions were offset by the negative impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange of 2%, unfavorable geographic mix of 1% and divestitures of 1%. The unit volume increase was driven by growth in IMEA (due to increased distribution) and Europe (due to market growth), partially offset by a decline in North America (due to retail inventory reduction). Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 2% driven by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and IMEA and low single-digit growth in Europe, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in North America. Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 0.1 points.
Net earnings increased 7% to $1.6 billion due to a 150 basis-point improvement in net earnings margin.

Net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin and a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin increase of 50 basis points was driven by productivity savings, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to higher foreign exchange transactional charges in the prior year period.

Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities, certain impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.
Corporate net sales increased 32% to $794 million due to an increase in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings increased $903 million to a loss of $527 million due primarily to the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset in the prior year, partially offset by incremental restructuring charges in the current year, comprised primarily of the non-cash charge of $752 million for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina.
Restructuring Program to Deliver Productivity and Cost Savings
The Company has historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of $250 to $500 million before tax. In fiscal 2024, the Company announced an incremental limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, and during the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed the limited market portfolio restructuring. The total incremental restructuring charges incurred under the program were $1.2 billion after tax.
In fiscal 2025, the Company incurred before tax restructuring costs of $1.1 billion, which include the non-cash charge of $752 million for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina. Restructuring accruals of $189 million as of June 30, 2025, are classified as current liabilities. Excluding the non-cash charges of foreign currency translation losses for Argentina, approximately 74% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2025 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our policies for restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.
Savings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program.
CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.
Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to
The Procter & Gamble Company        25
complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.

Operating Cash Flow
Operating cash flow was $17.8 billion in 2025, a 10% decrease versus the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for certain non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and loss on sale of assets) generated approximately $20.3 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts consumed $2.5 billion of cash in the period. Accounts receivable decreased slightly resulting in $45 million of cash flow help. Days sales outstanding were flat. Total inventories increased, consuming $324 million of cash, driven primarily by increased safety stock levels and higher commodity costs.
These increased input costs and higher inventory levels resulted in a four-day increase in days on hand
. Accounts payable decreased, resulting in $542 million use of cash, primarily driven by marketing and overhead activities. Other impacts reduced cash by $1.7 billion primarily driven by postretirement benefit impacts of $806, the payment of the transitional tax related to the 2017 U.S. Tax Act of $562 and a reduction in compensation and marketing accruals.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow.
We view adjusted free cash flow as an important non-GAAP measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the 2017 U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation.
Adjusted free cash flow was $14.6 billion in 2025, a decrease of 14% versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in operating cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the divestiture of operations in Argentina, was 87% in 2025.
Investing Cash Flow
Net investing activities used $3.8 billion of cash in 2025, primarily due to capital expenditures.
Financing Cash Flow
Net financing activities used $14.0 billion of cash in 2025, mainly due to dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases, partially offset by the impact of stock options and other and a net debt increase.
Liquidity
At June 30, 2025, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $10.7 billion, largely due to accounts payable, short-term borrowings and debt due within one year. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had $8.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various European and Asian countries. We did not have material cash and cash equivalents related to any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future.
We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.
On June 30, 2025, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.
We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in October 2029 and October 2025, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition
26        The Procter & Gamble Company
to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.

Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2028 are not currently determinable.

Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.
The Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.
Income Taxes
Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.
The Procter & Gamble Company        27
Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.
We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.
A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities in the jurisdictions where those functions are performed. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have several audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Because there are several estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the Company's income taxes.
Employee Benefits
We sponsor various postretirement benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other postretirement benefit (OPRB) plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPRB plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and net obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.
The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPRB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2025, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPRB assets was 6.0% and 8.5%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPRB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $155 million.
Since pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPRB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 4.2% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis-point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $85 million. The average discount rate on the OPRB plan of 5.9% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where most of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis-point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPRB expense by approximately $20 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPRB plans.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for those goodwill reporting units and intangible assets that do not have fair values that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have
28        The Procter & Gamble Company
an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values.
As previously disclosed, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was equivalent to the estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023.
Based on our impairment testing performed during the three months ended December 31, 2024, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%. As of June 30, 2025, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a further impairment charge.
The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates.
Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rates depend on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.
The discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.
The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.
We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2024, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates.

OTHER INFORMATION
Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments
As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. We leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize these operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations, as discussed below, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.
Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the RiskManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2025. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.
Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.
Interest Rate Exposure.
 We are exposed to interest rate movements due to our long and short-term borrowing program. Interest rate swaps are used to manage exposures to interest rates on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.
Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.
Currency Rate Exposure.
Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. We leverage the Company’s diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months.
Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.
Commodity Price Exposure.
We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, we did not have any financial commodity hedging activity.
Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP
In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors with a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.
Organic Sales Growth.
Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a

supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.
The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of net sales growth to organic sales growth:

Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow.
Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the 2017 U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity.
Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria and Argentina, and the Gillette intangible asset impairment charge. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.

Adjustments to Net Earnings relate to a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina in fiscal 2025 and certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, in fiscal 2024, and the after-tax Gillette intangible asset impairment charge in fiscal 2024.
Core EPS.
Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted EPS excluding items that are not judged by management to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:
•
Incremental restructuring:
 The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company started a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed this limited market portfolio restructuring with the substantial liquidation of its operations in Argentina. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges.
•
Intangible asset impairment:
 As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before
The Procter & Gamble Company        31
tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.
We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.
